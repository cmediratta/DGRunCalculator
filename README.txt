This is a heuristic to determine if your disc golf putt is +EV to run.
This is not scientific, it just gives you a general idea.

To run:
python3 dgstats.py < input.txt


input.txt format:

  +------------------------------+
  |<Your PDGA #>                 |
  |<Your Opponent's PDGA #>      |
  |<# of Holes Left>             |
  |<Net Strokes Up>              |
  |<% Chance Putt is Made>       |
  |<% Chance Comebacker is Made> |
  +------------------------------+


TBD: 
OB/Rollaway Chance
